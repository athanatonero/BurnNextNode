# Prototypes file
# Each entry is one line starting with the prototype file name, white space
# and after that pairs of substitution positions and data types separated by white space
# Valid data types are IPV4BIG, IPV4LIT, IPV4SWA, MACADDR, HEX8, HEX16, HEX32, STRING
# IPv4 address types are differnet ways to map the four octets:
# Decimal dotted IPv4 address 192.168.169.170 is C0 A8 A9 AA in hex and substituted as follows:
# IPV4BIG C0 A8 A9 AA (big-endian)
# IPV4LIT AA A9 A8 C0 (little-endian)
# IPV4SWA A9 AA C0 A8 (swapped words)
# MAC address and the hex types are susbtituted big-endian. Strings overwrite per character 
# starting from position without any checks or limits.
# Operations are performed in the order they are found in the line.
#
# Example entries
#foonode.bin 42 IPV4BIG 112 MACADDR 256 STRING
#barnode.hex 96 MACADDR 12 HEX16
